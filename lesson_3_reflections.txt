When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Creating a remote repository allows collaboration with others, you may want to commit pushes only when projects are functioning.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	By allowing manually pulling, this allows users to control the syncing rather than Git always pushing updates and thus hindering progress.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is when you want to clone another repository from another user, this will not affect their repository
	Cloning is when you want to clone a remote repository to local or from a local to another local.
	branching is to create another feature which is different from master and will not affect master.
