When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Creating a remote repository allows collaboration with others, you may want to commit pushes only when projects are functioning.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	By allowing manually pulling, this allows users to control the syncing rather than Git always pushing updates and thus hindering progress.
